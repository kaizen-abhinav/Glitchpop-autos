# Uselessness-by-Glitchpop üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Glitchpop


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Abhinav Varghese Abraham] - [STGITS]
- Member 2: Albin Chacko - STGITS
- Member 3: Akash Jis - STGITS

### Project Description
A distomat that measures distance between the instrument and an object using echo location 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
using rulers

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using a motor to turn on the switch

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Visual Studio Code
- Arduino IDE
- [Node.js
- Flutter
- ChatGPT
For Hardware:
- Arduino UNO
- HCSR0 Ultrasonic sensor
- 9V Battery
-Servo motor
-Jumper Cables
### Implementation
For Software: "still in progress"
# Installation
python idle
git
visual studio code
termux
hyper
node.js
chocolatey
ASL

# Run
[commands]

### Project Documentation
The project first started off as an automation system to automate switches using the home wifi, but then our NODEMCU burnt out along with having our battery explode, so it was very soon repurposed to a distomat/radar/proximity sensor device
