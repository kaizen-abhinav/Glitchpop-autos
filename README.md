# Uselessness-by-Glitchpop üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Glitchpop


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Abhinav Varghese Abraham] - [STGITS]
- Member 2: Albin Chacko - STGITS
- Member 3: Akash Jis - STGITS

### Project Description
Its basically a system that can auto detect when a water tank is full to a certain level and turn off the motor. it can also be repurposed into a radar or distance meter. Among others we have also developed code for a useless site that displays useless memes from reddit and songs from soundcloud. Overall id say its pretty fun but useless. The hosting is still a work in progress

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Getting up to turn off a switch

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using a motor to turn on the switch
